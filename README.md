# Digital Combinational Lock
 # Objective: 
A Digital Combinational Lock is to be designed using MAGIC layout tool. The key would be a 3 digit number. The key will be preset. We will have to give 3 values in sequence. If the values match the key, the lock will be opened. If there is any error, the clock must be reset. The system has these inputs: the values, new, start. The output is whether the lock is closed or open.The NEW must be made high when we enter a new value. The output becomes high when the lock is opened.
